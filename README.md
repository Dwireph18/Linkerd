      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Code of Conduct

# Linkerd Community Code of Conduct

As a CNCF project, we follow the [CNCF Contributor Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
Additionally, we are committed to the following guidelines adapted from the
[Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html):

## Community Guidelines

Our goal is to foster an inclusive and diverse community of technology
enthusiasts.

Try to be your best self. Treat your fellow community members with kindness and
empathy. We welcome disagreements when they are conducted respectfully and
without personal attacks.

We ask that you keep unstructured critique to a minimum. Disparaging remarks
about the project are unnecessary and a drain on community morale. Feedback
should be constructive and relevant. Having passionately held opinions on what
should improve is encouraged! We hope you will use that enthusiasm to roll up
your sleeves and get involved by submitting pull requests. We have additional
guidelines on [how to ask constructive
questions](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/wiki/How-To-Ask-Questions-in-Slack).

We don't tolerate insults, spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or harassment.
We don't tolerate sexual language, imagery, or unwanted advances. Private
harassment is also unacceptable.

We do our best to avoid
[subtle-isms](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules): small
actions that make others feel uncomfortable. If you witness a subtle-ism, you
may respectfully point it out to the person publicly or privately, or you may
ask a moderator to say something. Accidentally saying something biased is
common, expected, and readily forgiven. It is not in and of itself a bannable
offense.

## Moderation

If you feel that a channel needs moderation, please message one of the
[`maintainers`](MAINTAINERS.md) directly.

Moderators will issue a warning to users who don't follow the code of conduct. A
second offense results in a temporary ban, a third warrants a permanent ban.
It's at the moderator's discretion to un-ban a remorseful user, or immediately
ban a toxic user without warning. Unjustified bans can be appealed by contacting
<banhammer@buoyant.io>.

# Contributing to Linkerd2 #

:balloon: Thanks for your help improving the project!

## Getting Help ##

If you have a question about Linkerd2 or have encountered problems using it,
start by [asking a question in the forums][discourse] or join us in the
[#linkerd2 Slack channel][slack].

## Developer Certificate of Origin ##

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](DCO) file for the full text of what you must agree to.

### Option 1: commit message signoffs ###

One way to signify that you agree to the DCO for a commit is to add a line to
the git commit message:

```txt
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

### Option 2: public statement ###

If you've already made the commits and don't want to engage in git shenanigans
to retroactively apply the signoff as above, there is another option: leave a
comment on the PR with the following statement: "I agree to the DCO for all the
commits in this PR."

Note that this option also requires that your commits are made under your real
name and a reachable email address.

If you use this approach, the DCO bot will still complain, but maintainers will
override the DCO bot at merge time.

### Option 3: very simple changes ###

Changes that are trivial (e.g. spelling corrections, adding to ADOPTERS.md,
one-word changes) do not require a DCO signoff. Maintainers should feel free to
override the DCO bot for these changes.

## Submitting a Pull Request ##

Do you have an improvement?

1. Submit an [issue][issue] describing your proposed change.
2. We will try to respond to your issue promptly.
3. Fork this repo, develop and test your code changes. See the project's
   [README](README.md) for further information about working in this repository.
4. Submit a pull request against this repo's `main` branch.
    - Include instructions on how to test your changes.
    - If you are making a change to the user interface (UI), include a
      screenshot of the UI before and after your changes.
5. Your branch may be merged once all configured checks pass, including:
    - The branch has passed tests in CI.
    - A review from appropriate maintainers (see
      [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) and [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md))

## Committing ##

We prefer squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are
committed to main as a single commit. All pull requests are squashed when
merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit
message.

### Commit messages ###

Finalized commit messages should be in the following format:

```txt
Subject

Problem

Solution

Validation

Fixes #[GitHub issue ID]
```

#### Subject ####

- one line, <= 50 characters
- describe what is done; not the result
- use the active voice
- capitalize first word and proper nouns
- do not end in a period — this is a title/subject
- reference the GitHub issue by number

##### Examples #####

```txt
bad: server disconnects should cause dst client disconnects.
good: Propagate disconnects from source to destination
```

```txt
bad: support tls servers
good: Introduce support for server-side TLS (#347)
```

#### Problem ####

Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
thought of as being the motivation for your change.

#### Solution ####

Describe the modifications you've made.

If this PR changes a behavior, it is helpful to describe the difference between
the old behavior and the new behavior. Provide before and after screenshots,
example CLI output, or changed YAML where applicable.

Describe any implementation changes which are particularly complex or
unintuitive.

List any follow-up work that will need to be done in a future PR and link to any
relevant GitHub issues.

#### Validation ####

Describe the testing you've done to validate your change.  Give instructions for
reviewers to replicate your tests.  Performance-related changes should include
before- and after- benchmark results.
